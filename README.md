# Netflix Clone using MERN stack.

This repository contains source code for a Netflix Clone using MERN stack. This application was built to mimic the netflix signup process to browse workflow.

Redux is used for state management in this app. For the authentication process, JWT token is used with a silent refresh token workflow. I built my own custom hooks for form validation and submission and created a wrapper around the fetch api. Please free feel to contribute and share feedback on project.
